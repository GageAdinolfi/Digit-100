           <h2>Here is an essay of my experience after creating my websites on both wordpress and with html code.</h2>
        <p>The most significant challenge for a new learner in html coding is learning what code creates different effects. The advantage of using WordPress to create a website is that it is much easier to format, but the advantage with the GitHub/Oxygen page is once you master it you have a much higher skill ceiling. One of the biggest challenge there was for me was modifying the layout of each site. For example the format for images on Oxygen is different than it is on WordPress so some things don't transfer over well. Some skills that are necessary are memorization of how different code behaves, and being able to work through a problem until it is fixed. The biggest skill that I would like to improve on would be to learn more elements in code so that I have more creative freedom to customize my websites</p>
