             <h3>Dear Data: A Week of Visualization</h3>
                <p>For this project I was tasked with recording a data value that could be tracked througout the week. </p>
                <p> I chose to create a map with the path I walked around campus during the week, and made each day a different colored line.</p>

            <h3>3D Modeling and Spatial Annotation Project</h3>
               <p>In this group project we had to create a 3d scan of a part of the library and annotate different objects in it. </p>
              <p>Me and my group member decided to scan a part of the library that had a series of desks, and was surrounded by bookshelves.</p>
              <p>For our annotations we went with a spooky theme and annotated things such as a body without a head, a floating torso, and an abandoned study area.</p>
              <p>We also included factual annotations such as book divider or the history of how libraries are organized over time.</p>
